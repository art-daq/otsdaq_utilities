In order to offer the fonts offline, the google fonts here were downloaded from here: 

https://github.com/google/fonts/archive/master.zip

Periodically the fonts are updated, so it is desireable to refresh them.

Note: that fonts.css is important for Firefox display to use truetype!
This works for firefox and chrome (the extra src directives do not seem to help):
	 "src: url('/WebPath/fonts/comfortaa/Comfortaa-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');"


Here is an example approach to updating a particular font "Comfortaa":

	wget https://github.com/google/fonts/archive/master.zip
	unzip master.zip
	cp fonts-master/ofl/comfortaa <WebGUI path>/fonts/
	
Note the file names have to match the handling in WebGUI/css/fonts.css
	 "src: url('/WebPath/fonts/comfortaa/Comfortaa-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');"
